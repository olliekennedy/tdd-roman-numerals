# TDD Exercise: Roman Numerals Converter

## How to run this
1. Clone this repo
2. `./gradlew clean build`

## What is this?
This is an exercise in TDD where I aim to show my step-by-step TDD process to solve a relatively simple problem

## Principles
1. Red -> Green -> Refactor
2. The only permitted changes to the behaviour of the production code are changes to pass a failing test
3. Failing tests must be made to pass in the simplest way possible
4. Refactor after each new feature where possible, but don't prematurely optimise
5. Rule of Three when it comes to duplication
